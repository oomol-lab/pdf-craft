This release adds support for including cover images in both Markdown and EPUB conversions, enhancing the output format options.

## What's Changed

### Features

* **Cover Image Support**: Added `includes_cover` parameter to both `transform_markdown` and `transform_epub` functions, allowing you to include the PDF's cover page as an image in the output in https://github.com/oomol-lab/pdf-craft/pull/319
  - For Markdown conversion: The cover image is saved to the images folder and can be referenced in your document
  - For EPUB conversion: The cover image is properly embedded in the EPUB file structure
  - Default value is `False` for Markdown (to maintain backward compatibility) and `True` for EPUB

## Example Usage

### Markdown with Cover

```python
from pdf_craft import transform_markdown

transform_markdown(
    pdf_path="input.pdf",
    markdown_path="output.md",
    markdown_assets_path="images",
    includes_cover=True,  # Include cover image
)
```

### EPUB with Cover

```python
from pdf_craft import transform_epub, BookMeta

transform_epub(
    pdf_path="input.pdf",
    epub_path="output.epub",
    includes_cover=True,  # Include cover image (default)
    book_meta=BookMeta(
        title="Book Title",
        authors=["Author"],
    ),
)
```
